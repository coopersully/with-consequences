This plugin was originally developed for Halara Network on Minecraft: Java Edition. It serves to provide a hardcore gamemode while keeping the replay-ability of multiplayer survival servers. It adds a few game-mechanics and modifications while attempting to preserve the hardcore vanilla feel. If you'd like more information on this plugin, please [visit it's project page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/with-consequences.102698/) on spigot's website.
